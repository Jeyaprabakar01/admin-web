# Windsurf Agent Profile

## Project Snapshot
- Cerberus IAM Admin Web portal built with Next.js 16 (Pages Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui.
- Strict linting/formatting enforced through ESLint (`npm run lint`) and Prettier (`npm run format:fix`).
- Automated tests: Jest (unit/integration) and Playwright (e2e).

## What Matters Most
1. Uphold information architecture documented in `CLAUDE.md` and patterns captured in `.windsurfrules`.
2. Keep imports path-aliased with `@/`.
3. Use `NextPageWithLayout` + `getLayout` for pages requiring `AppLayout`.
4. Maintain type safetyâ€”no unchecked `any`, prefer explicit return types for exported functions.

## Development Workflow
- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`.
- Before submitting changes run:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run format:fix`
  - `npm test` (or specific suites)
  - `npm run test:e2e` when flows change.

## Testing Expectations
- Co-locate Jest tests beside implementation (`*.test.ts[x]`) and keep them deterministic.
- Add/adjust Playwright scenarios in `e2e/` for multi-tenant IAM paths and onboarding flows.
- Review `TESTING.md` for fixtures, command matrix, and troubleshooting.

## Change Management
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits.
- Pull requests require linked issue, clear summary, and screenshots/gifs for UI changes.
- Mention security reviewers for updates touching authentication, authorization, or secrets.
